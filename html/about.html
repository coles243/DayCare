                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Melissa Todt. I have been a daycare provider with a license through the State of New Hampshire for 21 years. I am CPR and First Aid Certified. I have 4 children of my own that were part of this daycare until they went to school. I started this daycare to create a place for young children to play, create, learn, and grow. I maintain a positive environment where the children can play with a diverse selection of toys in the inside play area. They also can play outside in a large fenced in backyard with houses, cars, chalk, large sandbox, water tables (in the summer) and snow (in the winter).</p>
                <p>This is a very family-oriented daycare. I have families that start here when their first child is born and stay until their last child goes to kindergarten. I want the kids to feel like this is a second home for them and I want parents to be at ease that it is a safe and welcoming place for their child to be.</p>
